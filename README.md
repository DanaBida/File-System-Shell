# File-System-Shell

This Project maintains a File-System.
To communicate with the file system, there is an implementation of a terminal.
The Terminal enables the user to "ask" the File-System to create/delete files/folders, print the contents of a directory etc. 
The file system consists of a root directory (“/”) and optionally other files and directories underneath.
The program has a global variable called verbose to control its output.
